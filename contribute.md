# Get involved

Hi there! We’re so glad you’ve decided to join the WordPress Sustainability Team.

We are a very young team, founded at WCEU 2023, so we are eager to welcome new members to help us make the WordPress Project a leader in sustainability. There are so many ways to contribute!

Please take a moment to read this onboarding introduction in order to understand how you can start contributing to the team.


## How we communicate

### Sustainability Team Slack channel

Come join us at the [#sustainability Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/). 

We meet almost every Friday at 12:00 UTC in the [#sustainability Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/). Please check the [#Make WordPress Meeting Agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/) for the right dates. 

### Sustainability Team blog

You can read our last posts, next Slack meeting agendas and previous Slack meeting chat summaries in our [P2](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/). Please, join in the discussions through the comments!

### Github

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/wordpress/sustainability/) to list and track our projects and share information with other teams. In our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/134/views/1) and [list of issues](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/issues) you can take a look at our ongoing projects.


## What do you need to contribute

Now that you have an idea of the overall structure of the Sustainability Team, let’s make sure you’re set up to contribute to the team. You will need to set up the three following accounts:

### 1. WordPress.org account

The most important account you’ll use is a WordPress.org account. This account is used to comment on the Sustainaibility Team blog and to create a Slack account (next step).

- Do you already have a WordPress.org account? Then [login here](https://login.wordpress.org) and you are ready for the next step.
- Don’t have a WordPress.org account yet? Then you can [create one](https://login.wordpress.org/register) by following one of these instructions (kindly created by other WordPress Teams and voluntears, thank you!):
  - [Video instructions to set up a WordPress.org account](https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/set-up-a-wordpress-org-account/)
  - [Step by step written instructions](https://github.com/WordPress/contributor-day-handbook/blob/master/*Start%20Here%20-%20General%20Guides/How%20to%20get%20a%20WordPress.org%20account.md)
 
After creating your account you will receive a “@chat.wordpress.org” username which means you do not have to share your personal email address with others in Slack. You can instead use the handle you choose.

### 2. Making WordPress Slack account

Our team (and the whole WordPress project) use Slack to communicate in real time.

To join WordPress Slack follow either the video you can find [in this guide](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) or these [step by step writen instructitions](https://github.com/WordPress/contributor-day-handbook/blob/master/*Start%20Here%20-%20General%20Guides/How%20to%20join%20the%20WordPress.org%20Slack%20instance.md). 

Once you are in, find the #Sustainability Channel and say hi! 

### 3. Github account and access

In the Sustainability Team, we use GitHub to track our ongoing projects. 

If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, you can sign up for one here: [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join). 

Once you have set up your account, you can send your WordPress profile URL to the Team Reps (eg via Slack) to ask for an invitation to our [Github repo](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability).


## How to take the first step

Once you have your 3 accounts, follow these steps: 

1. Say hi in our [#sustainability Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/). We will be very happy to welcome you! 
2. Listen and join the discussion in our [Slack weekly meetings](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/sustainability/) (both sync or async).
3. Leave your ideas on our posts, chat summaries and next agendas comments in [P2](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/). 
4. Assign yourself to the [Github issues](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/issues) or [roadmap projects](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/134/views/1) you are interested in contributing and start there!


## How to contribute to this Sustainability handbook

Our handbook is built using GitHub in [this repository](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability) and is always growing. 

You can contribute to this handbook by creating issues. You can also submit pull requests as you would normally do on GitHub.

If you’re not used to working with GitHub and you have access to our GitHub repo, you can also edit, or even add, pages there. Please refer to the [readme file](https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/blob/trunk/README.md) for more information.


## Have fun

We share a common goal: ensuring WordPress project longevity. Why? Because we love WordPress, both the software and its community. 

So enjoy the process of working together and keep in mind our [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/). Be friendly, helpful, and disagree in a productive way. :)
